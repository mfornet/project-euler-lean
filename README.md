# Project Euler - Proofs using LEAN

This repository contains proofs of some of the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) using the [LEAN](https://leanprover.github.io/) theorem prover.

The idea is to define the problem as close as possible to the definition given in the problem statement, write a solution to the problem, and then prove that the solution is correct, following the definition.
